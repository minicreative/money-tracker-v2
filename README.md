# money-tracker

Money Tracker is an open source tool for recording and displaying your expenses and income. This tool is motivated by the belief that ethics under capitalism are easier to achieve if individuals know where their money is going and how their habits dictate their position as economic agents.

In 2019 I built [money-tracker](https://github.com/minicreative/money-tracker) using React + Webpack. After years away from my computer, I started re-building the app using React + Typescript + Vite in 2025.
